## Scala GitHub Repository - Data Exploration and Visualization

This repo contains the code for data exploration and visualization using Scala GitHub Repository dataset. The dataset we will use, which has been previously mined and extracted from GitHub, is comprised of three files:
- `pulls_2011-2013.csv` contains the basic information about the pull requests, and spans from the end of 2011 up to (but not including) 2014.
- `pulls_2014-2018.csv` contains identical information, and spans from 2014 up to 2018.
- `pull_files.csv` contains the files that were modified by each pull request.

Further explanations are included in Jupyter notebook.
